### Why use Monitoshi to monitor my site?

Be notified by email when your website is down.

You will receive an email when your service is stopped.

You will be the first to know, before your customers start complaining.

Monitoshi has an API and can call web hooks. A simple way to create a "status page" or send a tweet when things go wrong.

You can extend the tool and contribute. Or hire us to do it.
